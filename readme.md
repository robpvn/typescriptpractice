#Typescriptpractice

Simply me mucking about with Typescript & node to try to learn stuff and making
some notes here and there. Not for any real kind of public consumption! 

I used tsd from DefinitelyTyped to get typings for stuff, and npm to get a
node module to include. (typings are committed, node_modules aren't.)

It's written using Visual Studio Code on Linux and so has some project settings
from that.

##TODO:
 - Figure out what should be committed and what shouldn't (tsd, npm, VSCode 
 config)
 - Add some unit testing
 - Find out if the referencepath stuff is still needed in Typescript 1.5 
 with tsconfig.json
 - Master tsconfig.json for a prettier build.
